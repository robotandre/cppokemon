# cppokemon
Making a c++ version of Pokemon to learn game development.

Starting as a text game, then upgrading to an ascii game, and finally to a SDL2 game.

Goals/Storyline:
    Have the game ask for the user's name, then introduce them to the world of pokemon.
    Ask what their friend's name is.
    Transport them to the world of pokemon, they are looking for the red gyarados.
    You see a bag on the floor left by the people that were just there.
    You were dumb enough to walk into tall grass without a pokemon to grab the bag. You got into a pokemon battle.
    But luckily inside the bag was pokeballs. Choose your pokemon.
    Fight the battle with their pokemon.
    Return the pokemon to their rightful owner.
    Professor gets mad at you for stealing, you go to jail.
    Game over.
